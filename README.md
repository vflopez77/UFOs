# UFO Web Search Application

## Overview

Interest in UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) is widespread.  However, it is not easy to know what these sightings actually consist of.  Our client wants to give access to UFO sightings data on the web so that the public can explore it for themselves.  We have developed a web app which gives the user the ability to filter on a number of criteria and narrow down the data as they please.

## Results

### Functionality

Our application allows searching on a number of criteria:<br><br>
<b>Date<br>
City<br>
State<br>
Country<br>
Phenomenon Shape</b>

### Output

A sample screen is below.  The actual criteria entered by the user are in black, and sample placeholders are in grey.<br>
There can be any combination of these criteria.  The results are displayed on the right:

## Summary

### Conclusions
- This application allows unprecedented access to UFO sightings data.  It is simple to operate and can be deployed for use from anywhere in the world.  It could be improved by adding an additional filter to search through the comments field.

- To continue the development of this applications, there should be a way for users to add their own experiences.  This could be in comments on one of the existing entries, or new entries (which would have to be vetted in some way).  Also, the data set should be broadened to include a wider date range to reflect a more complete history of UFO sightings.
