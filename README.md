# UFO Web Search Application

## Overview

Interest in UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) is widespread.  However, it is not easy to know what these sightings actually consist of.  Our client wants to give access to UFO sightings data on the web so that the public can explore it for themselves.  We have developed a web app which gives the user the ability to filter on a number of criteria and narrow down the data as they please.

## Results

Our application allows searching on a number of criteria:
Date
City
State
Country
Shape

Here is a sample screen.  The actual criteria entered by the user are in black and placeholder samples are in grey.  There can be any combination of criteria and the results are displayed on the right:
